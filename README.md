# sql-subqueries

## 🎯 Objective
Learn and practice advanced SQL subquery techniques using:
- Scalar subqueries
- Correlated subqueries
- Subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses
- IN, EXISTS, and comparison operators

## 🛠 Tools Used
- DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench

## 📁 Files
- `task6_subqueries.sql`: Contains SQL code with table creation, data insertion, and subquery examples.

## 📚 SQL Concepts Covered
1. **Scalar Subquery in SELECT** – Total amount spent by customer  
2. **Subquery with `IN`** – Customers with at least one order  
3. **Subquery with `EXISTS`** – Check existence of related data  
4. **Subquery with `=` Operator** – Customers spending more than 1000  
5. **Subquery in FROM Clause** – Derived tables for average order  
6. **Correlated Subquery** – Filter based on comparison to per-customer average

## ✅ Outcome
By completing this task, you gain confidence in:
- Writing nested queries
- Breaking complex logic into modular SQL expressions
- Using subqueries as filters, computed fields, and temporary tables

---

### 🧠 Tip
Try modifying the queries with additional filters, different operators, or add a `HAVING` clause for more practice!
